PDL-Fit-Solver version 0.0.1

This module provides a pure-PDL linear fitting capability.  At
the moment, the only other easily found linear fitting routines
for PDL require Slatec.  There may also be bindings for GSL in
this arena, but I did not find them.

This module implements the Householder orthogonalization method
to solve an overspecified system, that is, to perform a linear fit.
The module can fit any combination of a polynomial, funcion
references, and raw data to a dataset.  The hard-working code
is written in PDL::PP, while the hopefully straightforward front-end
is written in Perl.
